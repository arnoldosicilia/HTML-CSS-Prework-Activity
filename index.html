                    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                        <abbr>DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr>CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
                    <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                        efforts of folk like the <abbr>W3C</abbr>, <abbr>WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.

                        fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

                    <h3 class="striped-bg">So What is This About?</h3>
                    <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr>CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
                        inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
                        Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr>HTML</abbr> remains
                        the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr>CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
                    </p>
                    <p><abbr>CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style
                        of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited
                        is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able
                        to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of
                        the web; we can always push it further.

                        daunting at first if you´ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to

                        an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download
